# COD RAG LLM Version 2
*College of the Desert Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model*<br>

## info
at the moment it is using a [Qwen3 Embedding Model](https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b/api) and [GPT-4.1-mini](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-4.1-mini)<br>
but these can be replaced with just about anything else, i just chose these because they seemed a bit more lightweight, and i didnt want testing to be too expensive<br>
they can theoretically be replaced with just about anything, but honestly they are likely limited by the original course file and scraping method<br>
*this will be implemented on next*

# todo
 - work on scraping stuff
